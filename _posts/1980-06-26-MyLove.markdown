# This is for development!!!
An [C]empty street, an [G]empty house<br>
A [Em]hole inside my [Am]heart<br>
Im [F]all alone, the rooms are getting [G]smaller.

I [C]wonder how, I [G]wonder why,<br>
I [Em]wonder where they [Am]are<br>
The [F]days we had, the [D/F#]songs we sang [G]together, oh, yeah.<br>
[D | Bm7b13 | Em7 | Am7 | D9sus4 | Gsus4 â†’ G]
